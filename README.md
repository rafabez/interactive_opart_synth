## 📖 How It Works

### Visuals
- A grid of rectangles is dynamically generated based on the user's pointer position.
- Rectangles' sizes and colors change based on the cursor's X and Y positions, creating a dynamic, ever-evolving op art composition.

### Audio
- **Synthesizer**: A Tone.js MonoSynth generates sounds using a triangle wave oscillator.
- **Interactive Control**:
  - Pointer movements map to sound frequencies, detuning, and feedback levels.
  - Real-time audio modulation ensures seamless synchronization with visuals.

### Loading Animation
- Before the visuals and audio start, a Lottie animation is displayed to enhance user engagement during loading.
